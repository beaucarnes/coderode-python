# Learn Python Basics by Building a Blackjack Game

You are going to build a blackjack card game in Python.

Every card in blackjack has a suit, rank, and value. For example, the king of hearts has a rank of "king", a suit of "hearts", and a value of 10 (In blackjack, face cards are worth 10).

## 1 Create a string variable

Let's represent the king of hearts with Python code. Variables store data. The code already has a variable named `suit` that is set to the value of "hearts". Add a variable named `rank` and set it to the value of "K" (for king).

### 1.1

Add a variable named `rank` and set it to the value of "K" (for king).
